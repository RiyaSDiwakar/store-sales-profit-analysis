# Store Sales and Profit Analysis using Python

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the sales and profit performance of a
retail store using Python. The goal is to understand how different
product categories contribute to overall sales and profit and to
identify patterns that can help in better business decision-making.

## Problem Statement
Analyzing store sales and profit is important for optimizing pricing,
inventory management, and marketing strategies. This project uses
data-driven analysis to extract meaningful insights from retail sales
data.

## Dataset
The dataset contains retail store transaction data with attributes such
as:
- Sales
- Profit
- Product Category
- Sub-Category
- Order details

## Approach
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas
- Checked and handled missing values
- Calculated total sales and total profit
- Performed category-wise sales and profit analysis
- Visualized profit distribution using bar charts

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Results and Insights
- Identified total sales and profit of the store
- Determined which product categories generate higher sales and profit
- Visualized category-wise profit to make comparisons easier

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Python can be used for basic data
analysis and visualization to gain insights from business data. It
provides a foundation for more advanced analytics such as trend
analysis and predictive modeling.
